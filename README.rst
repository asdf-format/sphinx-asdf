``sphinx-asdf`` is a plugin for `sphinx`_ that enables generation of
documentation from `ASDF`_ schemas.

Installation
------------

To install the latest release on PyPI::

    $ pip install sphinx-asdf

The latest development version is available from the ``main`` branch `on
github`_. To clone the project:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/asdf-format/sphinx-asdf

To install:

::

    $ cd sphinx-asdf
    $ pip install .

To install in `development mode`_::

    $ pip install -e .

Usage
-----

The ``sphinx-asdf`` plugin provides two `sphinx directives`_,
``asdf-autoschemas`` and ``asdf-schema``.

The plugin also provides several configuration variables:

* ``asdf_schema_path``
* ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix``
* ``asdf_schema_reference_mappings``

Basic Example
*************

Consider a package with the following layout as an example::

   mypackage/
      setup.py
      mypackage/
         schemas/
            example.org/
               custom/
                  foo/
                     a.yaml
                     b.yaml
                     c.yaml
                  bar/
                     x.yaml
                     y.yaml
                     z.yaml
         ...
      docs/
         conf.py
         schemas.rst

This package provides schemas with tags that all have the prefix of
``tag:example.org/custom``. The layout of the schema directory reflects this
naming convention. We wish to provide documentation for all of our schemas.

First, we will add configuration variables to our ``docs/conf.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

   # This variable indicates the top-level directory containing schemas.
   # The path is relative to the location of conf.py in the package
   asdf_schema_path = "../mypackage/schemas"
   # This variable indicates the standard prefix that is common to all schemas
   # provided by the package.
   asdf_schema_standard_prefix = "example.org/custom"

The variables set in the ``docs/conf.py`` file indicate to ``sphinx-asdf``
where to locate the schemas based on the names we will use in the
documentation.

Now, we use the ``asdf-autoschemas`` directive in ``docs/schemas.rst`` to
create a table of contents for the schema documentation::

   .. asdf-autoschemas::

      foo/a
      foo/b
      foo/c
      bar/x
      bar/y
      bar/z

Each item in the list represents the name of a schema to be included in the
documents. The names are **not** paths to the schema files and should not
include the file extension. Resolution of the names to actual schema files is
handled by the ``asdf_schema_path`` and ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix``
configuration variables.

We can also use multiple ``asdf-autoschemas`` directives if we wish::

   These schemas are part of foo:

   .. asdf-autoschemas::

      foo/a
      foo/b
      foo/c

   And these schemas are part of bar:

   .. asdf-autoschemas::

      bar/x
      bar/y
      bar/z


When ``sphinx-build`` runs, the ``sphinx-asdf`` plugin will automatically
generate schema documentation for each of the schemas listed in each
``asdf-autoschemas`` directive. In the documentation, each ``asdf-autoschemas``
directive will be replaced with a table of contents that contains links to each
of the listed schema documents.

.. _Directive settings:

Directive settings
******************

While the ``asdf_schema_path`` and ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix``
configuration variables set global schema resolution settings, it is also
possible to set per-directive settings. For example, we could have done the
following::

   .. asdf-autoschemas::
      :schema_root: ../mypackage/schemas
      :standard_prefix: example.org/custom

This would eliminate the need to set global settings. It also allows any
global settings to be overridden on a per-directive basis.

.. note::

   The ``:schema_root:`` argument requires a path that is relative to
   the ``sphinx`` configuration file.

External References
*******************

Schema references to other schemas in the same package are automatically
converted to links in the generated documentation. (This assumes that all of
the references correspond to schemas that are explicitly generated by an
``asdf-autoschemas`` directive). However, sometimes it is necessary to resolve
references to schemas in other packages. The ``asdf_schema_reference_mapping``
configuration variable is provided for this purpose. It enables a mapping
between references that begin with a particular prefix to a URL indicating
another package's documentation.

For example, to enable references to the ASDF Standard documentation to be
resolved as links, include the following in your ``docs/conf.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

   asdf_schema_reference_mappings = [
       ('tag:stsci.edu:asdf',
        'http://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/stsci.edu/asdf/'),
   ]

Inline documentation
********************

The ``asdf-autoschemas`` directive automatically generates individual schema
documentation pages and creates a table of contents. However, sometimes it may
be useful to include schema documentation inline inside another document. The
``asdf-schema`` directive is provided for this purpose.

Using the package described above as an example, the ``asdf-schema`` directive
can be used to document a single schema inside of another document::

   .. asdf-schema::

      foo/a

The behavior of the ``asdf-schema`` directive is also governed by the
``asdf_schema_path`` and ``asdf_schema_standard_prefix`` global configuration
variables. The directive also accepts the same ``:schema_root:`` and
``:standard_prefix:`` arguments as ``asdf-autoschemas`` (see `Directive
settings`_ above) for per-directive configuration.
